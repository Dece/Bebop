Bebop
=====

Bebop is a [Gemini][gemini] browser for the terminal, focusing on practicality
and speed. It is a personal project to learn how to use ncurses and try new
ways to explore the Geminispace. It borrows some ideas from [Amfora][amfora],
another great terminal browser, Vim for interactivity and tries to support mouse
usage decently.

If you are interested in Gemini and looking for a desktop/laptop client, I
recommend trying a graphical one like the excellent [Lagrange][lagrange] or
[Kristall][kristall], or Amfora if you're feeling more at home in the terminal.
Bebop won't attempt to support every feature other clients might have.

It passes the Conman's client test but not Egsam's for now.

- Buffers (or tabs if you prefer).

### What is not planned for now

    aggregator at the moment.
